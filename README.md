# Steps Tracker app
idk why I'm doing this

## This is an app where you can manually enter your step count (or something else you want to keep track of) daily
> Useful for watches, pedometers or other fitness trackers without bluetooth integration - basically "standalone devices"

## Features:

h:  Display a list of commands  
w:  Writes a step count into the csv  
q:  Exit the program  
ls: Displays the current full csv  
r: Removes a step count from the csv  
m: Modifies a step count from the csv  

---

## TO-DO:
- Figure out the current date and fetch user input, then write both into a csv file
- Options:
    - hi: Displays the current highest step count
    - lo: Displays the current lowest step count
