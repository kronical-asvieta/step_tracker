# Steps Tracker app
> idk why I'm doing this

## This is an app where you can manually enter your step count (or something else you want to keep track of) daily
Useful for watches, pedometers or other fitness trackers without bluetooth integration - basically "standalone devices"

## Features:

h:  Display a list of commands  
w:  Writes a step count into the csv  
q:  Exit the program  
ls: Displays the current full csv  
r: Removes a step count from the csv  
m: Modifies a step count from the csv  

---

## TO-DO:
- differentiate between creating a step entry for the current date vs. a custom one (detect whether the date is in the future or not)
- Options:
    - hi: Displays the current highest step count
    - lo: Displays the current lowest step count
