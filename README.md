# Steps Tracker app
idk why I'm doing this

## This is an app where you can manually enter your step count (or something else you want to keep track of) daily
> Useful for watches, pedometers or other fitness trackers without bluetooth integration - basically "standalone devices"

## Features:

- none ( so far )

---

## TO-DO:
- Figure out the current date and fetch user input, then write both into a csv file
- Options:
    - w: Writes a step count into the csv
    - r: Removes a step count from the csv
    - m: Modified a step count from the csv
    - hi: Displays the current highest step count
    - lo: Displays the current lowest step count
    - ls: Displays the current full csv
