# Steps Tracker app
> idk why I'm doing this

## This is an app where you can manually enter your step count (or something else you want to keep track of) daily
Useful for watches, pedometers or other fitness trackers without bluetooth integration - basically "standalone devices"

## Features:

- Write a step count into the database (current/custom date)  
- Remove a step count from the database  
- Show the step count of a specific date  
- Modify a step count from the database  
- Display the current full database  
- Display the current highest step count  
- Display the current lowest step count  

---

## TO-DO:
- Add a way of clearing the entire database maybe
- Maybe add a sorting algorithm
- More input error handling
